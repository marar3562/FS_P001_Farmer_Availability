# FS_P001_Farmer_Availability
This project is focused on standardizing the way we acquire farmer produce availability and place that availability into our Food List document. 

## Requirements
1. Standardize way we acquire farmer produce availability and enter into the Food List document each week
  + Ideally with Food List  / Farmigo naming convention (**Item** - Type, Detail and Size)
  + Using Fair Shares **per** values
  + **Quantity** and **Price** of items
  + Will the item come **pre-bagged**?
  + Who is providing the bag (**bag provider**)?
  + What else should we know about this item (**notes**)?
2. Make it easy on farmers to provide this list to us each week (copy / paste or send Excel / Sheets file)
3. Need to provide directions / notes to farmers about Fair Shares naming conventions (Ex: what does a Large Squash mean? Use $3 per lb as the default note)
4. Four dashboards for largest farmers (Biver, Earthdance, Kopmann, & Nolte) while a single dashboard for seasonal / specialty farms (Bee Simple, Blue Heron, etc.)
5. Bonus: Provide farmers with Fair Sharesâ€™ **typical pricing** and **purchase history** insights
  + May need to isolate pricing by farmer within separate dashboards (worry of exposing $)
